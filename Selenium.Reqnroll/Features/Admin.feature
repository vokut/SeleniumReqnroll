Feature: Admin management
As an admin user
I want to manage job titles and locations
So that organizational data stays up to date

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as admin
    And I am on the "Admin" section

  Scenario: Create a new job title
    When I open the "Job" -> "Job Titles" section
    And I add a new job title
    Then I should see the "Successfully Saved" message

  Scenario: Create a new location
    When I open the "Organization" -> "Locations" section
    And I add a new location
    Then I should see the "Successfully Saved" message

  Scenario: Delete a location
    When I open the "Organization" -> "Locations" section
    And I create a temporary location
    And I search for that location
    And I delete the first located record
    Then I should see the "Successfully Deleted" message
    And I should see the "No Records Found" message
